Values in max wind column (column 4) were replaced with values from the 5 second average (column 3).
This indicates that non-numeric values were in the max wind speed column and likely presenting as NAs, which can happen during a deployment
where max wind was not configured. Please note that this replacement will still have max wind speed in the column heading but
it will represent the average 5 second wind speed. This will ensure downstream processing of the data set into NVSPL, metrics, and plotting in
the Acoustic Monitoring Toolbox. Any reporting of this dataset should clarify that max wind speeds were replaced with the average wind speeds.
